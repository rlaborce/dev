<div class="home">
My name is Neil and I am an SEO Engineer at Treefrog Inc. I take a results-oriented, data-driven, users-first approach to search engine optimization. Before that I opened my own business after having worked in the energy industry for a few years. I studied electrical engineering at Ryerson University. I am inherently a curious individual and so I'm always seeking and finding new things.</div>
