<br>My name is Neil and I am an SEO Engineer at <a href="https://www.treefrog.ca">Treefrog Inc.</a> I take a results-oriented, data-driven, users-first approach to optimizing websites. I also believe simplicity is key to quality user experience. Inherently curious, I am in constant search for knowledge and wisdom to better myself and others. This blog serves as documentation for my progress in webmastering as well as to share some thoughts, insights and daily happenings.
