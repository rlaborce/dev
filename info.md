<br>My career began in 2011 in the energy industry as an internship student. After graduating in 2012 with a Bachelor's Degree in Electrical Engineering from Ryerson Univeristy, I worked in the solar energy industry. I then opened a business in 2014, looking to expand my professional horizon. Understanding the importance of an online presence, I dove deeply into web development and search engine optimization. Curious in my exploration to learn more about SEO, I joined Treefrog in 2015 as an SEO Engineer.
