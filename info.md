<br>My name is Neil Laborce and my professional career began in 2011 working for a major utility company as an internship student. After graduating with a Bachelor's Degree in Electrical Engineering from Ryerson Univeristy in 2012, I continued working in the energy industry analyzing solar panel system performance. Looking to expand my professional horizon and a change in scenery, I opened my own business in 2014. Understanding the importance of digital marketing and having an online presence, I dove deeply into web development. I would eventually discover and utilize the powers of social media marketing, content marketing and most importantly search engine optimization. Curious in my exploration of the digital world and motivated to learn more about SEO, I joined Treefrog in 2015 as an SEO Engineer.
