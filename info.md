<br>
<br>I'm a former electrical engineering undergrad who worked in the solar energy industry for several years. During my tenure, I got into a motorcycle accident and had an epiphany to start my own business. This business eventually failed but in the process, I learned so much about <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/from-engineering-to-marketing/">digital marketing</a>. I reset my career and started working in SEO and SEM.
<br>
<br>Today, I lead an award-winning team of digital marketers strategizing, managing and optimizing campaigns with multi-million dollar budgets. As a seasoned digital marketer, I take a results-oriented, data-driven, people-first approach to digital marketing. By leveraging my experiences in engineering and entrepreneurship with marketing, I create meaningful digital experiences using data, insight and smart automation.
