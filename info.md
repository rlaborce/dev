<br>My career began in 2010 in the energy industry as an internship student. I graduated in 2012 with a Bachelor's Degree in Electrical Engineering from Ryerson University. After working in the solar energy industry for a few years, I decided to try and start my own retail business in 2014. Understanding the importance of an online presence, I dove deeply into web development and search engine optimization. Curious in my exploration of SEO, I joined Treefrog Inc. in 2015.
