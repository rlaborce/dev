  Admittedly, I haven't seen a majority of these click types since I've been primarily focused on Search Ads. Particularly, I haven't seen any information on Broadband Plan and Wireless Plan. And I'm not too sure on what Other and Unknown exactly mean. 
  
  <strong>If you know any of what the other click types mean, please give me a shout!</strong>
