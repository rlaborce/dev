  <h1>My First Post Ever</h1>
  <br>Congratulations - Thank you, thank you!
  <br>
  <br>My name is Neil and I'm an SEO Engineer at Treefrog Inc. I wasn't always spending my day on the Internet optimizing websites; in fact, I was working in a completely different industry. My career began in 2010 as an internship student for Hydro One. In that role, I built a database that housed 100,000 data points for 1011 distribution stations surveyed across the province. After completing my internship, I finished my last year of school in 2012 and received a Bachelor's Degree in Electrical Engineering from Ryerson University. I then worked in the solar energy industry for a few years, analyzing the performance for various rooftop solar installations. 
  
  <br>Looking to expand my horizon and a change of scenery, I decided to start my own retail business in 2014. Understanding the importance of an online presence, I dove deeply into web development, learning HTML, CSS and JavaScript in the process. I also began researching SEO and applying all the best practices at the time. Unfortunately, my business didn't last very long and so I wasn't able to fully see the results of my optimization efforts. But through this failed endeavour, I was equipped with newfound knowledge in web development and search engine optimization. A few months later, I found opportunity with Treefrog Inc. and officially joined the digital agency in December of 2015.

  <br> I’ve been working closely with our clients taking a results-oriented, data-driven, users-first approach to optimizing websites. With SEO, I’ve been able to utilize my skills in engineering, web development and writing. In the past year, I've learned so much more about SEO. And so, this blog serves as documentation for my progress in webmastering. I'll be blogging about things I learn, tactics and strategies, tests and results as well as random thoughts, opinions and daily happenings.

  <br>Thank you for reading. And thank you for joining me in my journey through search engine optimization!
  <br>
  <br>Neil.
