  So I've completely failed in keeping this blog up to date. It's been about 6 months since my last post! <strong>Faaaail!</strong> I've been meaning to get back to blogging but my work schedule just went crazy these past few months...

  <br/>
  <br/>But now that I've made some minor tweaks to the blog, I'm going to start posting again. I'm going to try to post at least once a week - on something new I learned at work. I may have to retro actively write a few blog posts for all the things I learned just in the last 6 months. There's so many! I don't know where to start.
  <br>
  <br>I've become really focused on Adwords and Tag Manager so I guess I'll start on that... starting next week!
  <br>  
  <br>Stay tuned,
  <br>Neil Laborce.
